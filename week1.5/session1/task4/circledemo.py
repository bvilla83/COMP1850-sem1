# Week 1.5, Session 1: Task 4

# Add one or more import statements here to give this program
# access to the Point and Circle classes defined in geometry.py

from geometry import Point, Circle

# Write a program here that
#  - Creates a Point object, to represent the centre of a circle
#  - Creates a Circle object, using the Point object and a value for radius
#  - Displays the area of the circle
#  - Displays the perimeter of the circle

p = Point(4, 5)
circle = Circle(3, p)

print(circle.area())
print(circle.perimeter())
